## How to get involved

Always clone the main branch. As soon as you clone the main branch create a new local branch.

e.g.
git checkout -b [name-of-the-branch]
 - The name of the branch has to start with the ticket number and be followed by the title of the ticket
 - After you are done with the ticket use the git add command and commited with a good message.
 - git push origin [name-of-the-branch]
 - On the GitHub website create a pull request from the branch and wait for the tests to run.
 - After the tests are successful, ping me to review it
 - If I approve it, merge it to the staging branch
 - After you merge it on the staging, open the following link to test it [https://is-gowork.netlify.app/]
 - If you are satisfied with the results, merge it to the main branch
